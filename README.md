# PMV_code
We introduce a novel Projection Mean Variance(PMV) measure to construct a  nonparametric test for the multi-sample hypothesis of equal distributions for univariate or multivariate response.

The proposed PMV measure generalizes the mean variance index via the projection technique. The PMV measure can yield an analogous variance components decomposition. By this decomposition, an ANOVA F statistic is derived to test the multi-sample problem. The test is free of tuning parameters and does not require moment conditions on the response.<br>
